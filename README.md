I used Arduino Yun to make a car. Then I connect the Arduino Yun with a Webcam.
Arduino Yun caught streaming with webcam and send the streaming through wifi to my laptop.
My laptop ran the  OpenCV code to find out where is the object that we were tracking.
Then sent requests back to the Arduino Yun to change direction of the car.
